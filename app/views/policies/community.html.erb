		<h2>Community Standards</h2>
		<p>The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of <b>wislr</b>. If you have feedback or questions about these guidelines, you can send us an email hello@wislr.me</p>
	
		<h3>Be Nice.</h3>
		<p>Now that you're in high school, we're pretty sure you know what behavior is acceptable and what is not. If you need a refresher, here's the Cliffs Notes version.</p>
		<p>Our wisls are cool because they allow you to see what other people think about different topics. It's okay if you don't agree with the results of a wisl or opinion being shared.</p>	
		<h3>Think.</h3>
		<p>Any pictures you share in a wisl are public. That means everyone can see that picture of your friend sleeping on the bus you posted. Not cool. </p>
		<p>All content (photos, comments) posted on WISLR will be moderated using our safety and content filters.</p>
		<p>Spam is prohibited. This includes product advertisements, link spam and links to pornography. If your judgment proves to be poor we will send you to detention with Bart Simpson. </p>
		<h3>Don't Be Mean.</h3>
		<p>We take bullying and threats very seriously. Please refrain from flaming, using hate speech, being mean, bullying or engaging in any activity that may hurt your fellow WISLRer. So, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members. </p>
		<h3>Have Fun.</h3>
		<p>Post wisls. Find out what your friends, classmates and other teens your age think about, well, just about anything you want. </p>
		<p> Share. Use our Messaging feature to send stickers, LOL, OMG and keep friends in the loop. </p>
		<h3>Don't Be Naked.</h3>
		<p>If we find that you've uploaded profile selfie or wisl that contains inappropriate content (you know, nudity or pornography), we'll remove the photo, flag your account as restricted and send you a warning. </p>
		<p> If we find you doing it again, we'll delete your account. </p>

		<h3>Be YOU.</h3>
		<p> On WISLR teens connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent. </p>
		<p> Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or creating multiple accounts undermines our community and violates WISLR's terms. </p>
		<h3>Seek Help.</h3>
		<p> WISLR takes threats of self-harm, photos of self-mutilation, eating disorders and drug abuse very seriously. If you see something on WISLR that worries you, please report it so we can take a look at it. If you or a friend needs needs help, visit the Crisis Text Hotline website or text ANSWER to 839863 (24/7). If it is an emergency dial 911. </p>
